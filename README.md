Section 1: Software and platform section
    Pyhton was used to complete this project.
    The VADER software package was used in this analysis VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a software package used for sentiment analysis of text. It is specifically designed to analyze the sentiment of text data in a way that is aware of the valence, or emotional intensity, of words.
    VADER created three scores for each lyric line: positive, negative, and neutral. The team will find the VADER score for each line, average the score from each song into their corresponding album. Each album will be assigned a VADER score (based on how positive the song will be). Song scores will be graphed, comparing each one to one another.
    Windows 11 was the platform used to complete this analysis

Section 3: Steps the group used and the instructions for reproducing the results: 
1. Gather the raw data – We secured a complete dataset of Swift’s lyrics, separated line-by-line in Kaggle.
2. Set up the VADER program – Using online instructional websites as a model we set up the VADER package in python to complete the initial analysis of the data.
3. We ran the VADER program on each song line to determine a negativity score, positivity score, and a neutral score.
4. We combined the VADER analysis results – the negativity score, positivity score, and a neutral score – into a single score for each lyric line.
5. We combined the single score from step 4 of each lyric line into a singular score for each song and album.
6. We compared the sentiment score of Swift’s albums to one another to understand the trend of her music.
